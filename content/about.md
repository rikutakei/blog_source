Hi there, I'm Riku.

I'm an Assistant Research Fellow at the University of Otago, working on projects geared towards Bioinformatics.
I have worked with a variety of data during my Masters and my current job, including microarrays, RNA-seq, genotype data, and methylation microarray data.

I think I'm pretty good with using terminal, but I'd say I'm better at using Google.
I mainly work on a Mac/Unix computer (`ssh`ing into a RHEL server, or a NeSI computer), and have Arch Linux running at home.
No, I don't use Windows --- ditched that shite of an OS since 2014 and I'm _**never**_ going back.

I've got a bad habit where, when I get interested in something, I _really_ get into it until I get a good idea of how it works or become (relaticely) good at it.
Past examples include: Vim, LaTeX, and this website/blog (Hugo).
So if you find something cool or interesting, let me know _**ASAP**_.

Anyhow, I hope you enjoy reading some of my posts, and if you learn something new from it, that'll make my day.

# Background

I graduated from the University of Otago with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry in 2014, and during my three years of undergrad study, I have also been taking Computer Science papers (which I *thought* I had a Minor in, but I didn't --- awkward :confused:).

Turns out programming skills and basic computer knowledge are actually quite useful in the field of biology, and so I decided to carry on with my study at Otago doing a Master of Science in Biochemistry, working on an entirely bioinformatic project.

Fast-forward two years --- after a terrible interview with my future bosses, I somehow managed to get a job as an Assistant Research Fellow at the same University, and started working as I was finishing writing up my thesis.
That was a bit stressful, but that's what you get for overestimating your writing ability.

Currently, I am a year into my first job and enjoy working as a researcher/programmer, and just pondering everyday about what to do in the future.
Like what to get for lunch, or what to make for dinner.
Secure job? PhD? Nah, they can wait -- I'll eventually get around to it.
