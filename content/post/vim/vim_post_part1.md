# Introduction

Alright, so you've decided that learning Vim was worth your precious time ~~(and you've made the right choice)~~.

But where do you begin?

Google is usually a good place to begin your search of "How do I learn Vim".
And it will probably tell you to go to a random Vim emulator website and/or tell you to fire up `vimtutor` on the command line to "get used to Vim".

I personally disagree with the methodology.

Yes, you have to get used to Vim somehow, but these programs and emulators are not good for this -- I don't think you will learn anything useful from them, other than how to edit stuff the way you normally would.

So, in this post, I would like to first cover the basic concepts of Vim, and then the commands/keys (that you probably won't learn in the tutorial) to get you started.

Specifically, I would like to cover:

- Modes of Vim
- Saving/quitting Vim
- Moving around Vim
- Basic editing commands
- Extra and useful commands












The first "wall" that everyone hits when learning Vim is ***"How the fuck do I get out of Vim"***.
